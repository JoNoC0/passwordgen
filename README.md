# Password Generator

Password generator will help a user create a randomized password based on the user's specific criterias. The generator will ask a series questions/statements, based on those responses, via "confirm" prompts a password will be created. User will need to "confirm" or "cancel" their responses to:

    -What the length of password should be?
    -Would lowercase letters be included?
    -Would uppercase letters be included?
    -Would symbols be included?
    -Would numbers be included?

The generator will take the responses then make a randomized password when the "generate password" button is clicked.
